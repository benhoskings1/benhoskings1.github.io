        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
            After listening to the wonderful <i>Google DeepMind: The Podcast</i>, and having wanted to take a try at
            running some reinforcement learning models for a while, I finally found the inspiration to get stuck in.

            This repo was thus a result of a decent amount of YouTube videos, trial and error, and also my first
            attempt at #vibe-coding (going in as a definite sceptic!)
