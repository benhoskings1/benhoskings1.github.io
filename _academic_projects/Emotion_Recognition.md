## Project Description 
The project produced a novel facial emotion recognition framework, that is capabale of classifying images into one of Ekman's 6 basic emotions. As detailed in the 40 page technical report, a comprehensive pre-processing module, novel feature representaion and a novel classification module have been developed. 

As highlighted in the literature, the field suffers from a lack of transparency and as such, a key objective of the project was for the results to be easily reproducible. Therefore, the entire code for the project is available via the link below, as well as the detailed description of the method being presented in the technical report. 

## Project Feedback 
"The project successfully developed a framework for FER using 3D facial point-cloud data. The framework achieves recognition accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods. It introduces a novel and robust nose tip detection and proposes features (and the corresponding extraction methods) for robust FER. The substantial and very high-quality work demonstrate wide knowledge and understanding. The report is also clearly written and interestingly presented." - *First Assessor*

"A well written report that shows conference in the methodology. It is clear that the student has understood the challenges and has worked to place their own work in the context of the published work. A compelling case is made for the suggested method and it is implemented smoothly. A good analysis is made comparing the results and proposing changes to improve performance. Overall an excellent thesis." - *Second Assessor*
