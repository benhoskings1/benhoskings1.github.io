    Abstract
  </h3>
  <p>
    The proposed Health and Emotion Remote Observation (HERO) system successfully evaluates
    symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) across three core components: physical, 
    cognitive, and wellbeing assessments. This is achieved via a research-backed digital consultation 
    experience that employs the use of questions, cognitive tests, and sensor-based evaluations to 
    collect a holistic data sample of neurodegenerative disease (ND) symptoms in the user. Users 
    complete this consultation by interacting with an intuitive and accessible device that has 
    centered user feedback in the iteration of its design. These interactions provide a multi-modal 
    evaluation of ND progression in the user which is communicated to healthcare professionals (HCP)s 
    via a practical dashboard. Ultimately, the HERO System acts as a successful prototype for missing 
    components in long-term ND care and helps to alleviate the challenges associated with long-term ND 
    prognosis for both patients and practitioners.
