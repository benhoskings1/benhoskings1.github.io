      Project Abstract
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Health and Emotion Remote Observation (HERO) system successfully evaluates
      symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) across three core components: physical,
      cognitive, and wellbeing assessments. This is achieved via a research-backed digital consultation
      experience that employs the use of questions, cognitive tests, and sensor-based evaluations to
      collect a holistic data sample of neurodegenerative disease (ND) symptoms in the user. Users
      complete this consultation by interacting with an intuitive and accessible device that has
      centered user feedback in the iteration of its design. These interactions provide a multi-modal
      evaluation of ND progression in the user which is communicated to healthcare professionals (HCP)s
      via a practical dashboard. Ultimately, the HERO System acts as a successful prototype for missing
      components in long-term ND care and helps to alleviate the challenges associated with long-term ND
      prognosis for both patients and practitioners.
