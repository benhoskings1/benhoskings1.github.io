    Project Description 
  </h2>

  <p>
    This project was primarily undertaken to explore the benefits of using transfer learning to produce an accurate system for a new task. We captured all of the training data, and subsequently re-trained two neural networks: A YoloV4 networka and a ResNet-50 network. The YoloV4 network produced the hand region identification for image segmentation, and subsequently the ResNet-50 was used to classify the segmented image.
