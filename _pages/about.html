    Hi there! <br>
    I'm Ben, and I have just completed Masters Degree in Systems Engineering at the Univeristy of Warwick <i class="fa-solid fa-user-graduate"></i>.
    Over the last 4 years I have developed a keen interest in software engineering, and more recently this 
    has been focused on the applications of computational intelligence in healthcare. The completion of my two 
    dissertation projects (
      <a href="https://benhoskings1.github.io/academic_projects/HERO">H.E.R.O System</a>, 
      <a href="https://benhoskings1.github.io/academic_projects/emotion_recognition">Emotion Recognition</a>
      ) have highlighted my interests in affective computing and computer vision, as well as the application
      of machine leaning technologies to enhance multiple aspects of peopleâ€™s lives.
  </p>
  <p>
    From competing at an international level in Alpine Skiing whilst in school, 
    to completing the London Marathon and two 70.3 Ironmans  by 21, sport has always been a major part 
    of my life. I love to push myself by undertaking major sporting events and look forward to applying 
    this dedication to the early stage of my career.
